# Performance Metrics:

Accuracy (% correct):  
(TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)  

Optimise sensitivity (recall) for diagnostic scenarios i.e. when a disease is suspected based on prior clinical findings
Recall (Sensitivity):  
TP / (TP + FN)

Precision (PPV):  
TP / (TP + FP)

Optimise specificity for screening-type scenarios i.e. if this algorithm was widely applied to a low-prevalence disease.
Specificity:   
TN / (TN + FP)

F1-Score:  
2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
